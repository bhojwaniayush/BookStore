	<TD>Yann Martel's Life of Pi is a transformative novel, an astonishing work of imagination that will delight and stun readers in equal measure. It is a triumph of storytelling and a tale that will, as one character puts it, make you believe in God. After the tragic sinking of a cargo ship, a solitary lifeboat remains bobbing on the wide, wild Pacific. The crew of the surviving vessel consists of a hyena, one zebra (with broken leg), an orang-utan, a 450-pound Royal Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker and Pi - a 16-year-old Indian boy.</TD>

	<TD>When we last saw her, Aileana Kameron, the Falconer, disappeared through the fae portal that she was trying to close forever. When she escapes and reenters the human world, she finds her beloved city—indeed, the entire world—has been destroyed, and the fae world itself is slowly dying. Somehow Aileana is the key to preserving both worlds—but how? This much-anticipated second chapter in the Falconer trilogy "combines vivid world-building with action-packed fight sequences"</TD>
